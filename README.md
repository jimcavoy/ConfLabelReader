# ConfLabelReader
The ConfLabelReader project is a collection of libraries and a tool to extract 
STANAG 4774/4778 Confidentiality Metadata Labels from a STANAG 4609 Motion
Imagery stream (MPEG-2 Transport Stream).

The project is composed of multiple sub-projects, which are as follows:

* __LabelDemux__: A library that demultiplexes the MPEG-2 transport stream, and 
extracts the label.  The label is EXI encoded and has to be transcoded to XML
if it needs to be human-readable.  The `exi2xml` library can be used to transcode
the label to XML.  `LabelDemux` library has an external dependency on 
[mp2tp library](https://github.com/jimcavoy/mp2tp), which is needed to be built and installed.

* __exi2xml__: A library to transcode EXI-encoded labels to XML text format.  The library is
generic and can decode EXI labels based on different XML schemas.  This library has 
an external dependency on [EXIP library](https://github.com/rwl/exip).  See Readme.md in the 
exipCMake folder how to build and install `exip` library.

* __ConfLabelReader__: A tool that reads a MPEG-2 transport stream from a file or standard input stream (stdin), and
prints a Confidentiality Metadata Label in XML to a file or standard output stream (stdout).  The tool  
depends on `exi2xml` and `LabelDemux` libraries.

The project is cross-platform and can be built and run on both Windows and
Linux platforms.
