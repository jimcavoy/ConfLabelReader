# LabelDemux Library
The `LabelDemux` library demultiplexes a MPEG-2 transport stream, and extracts Confidentiality Metadata Label.  
The extracted label will require to be decoded so it can be human readable.  The `exi2xml` library in this project can transcode the
EXI encoded label to XML text format.

## Build
This library is depended on `mp2tp` library which can be cloned from here:

https://github.com/jimcavoy/mp2tp

Build and install `mp2tp` library outside the ConfLabelReader folder before building LabelDemux.
